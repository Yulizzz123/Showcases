HANGMAN - How to Play 

1. Hangman is a game that can be played individually, in groups or with competing parties.

2. The goal is to guess the letters of a word thought up by the hangman within a limited number of trials.

3. For every wrong guess, the hangman draws another stroke of a man to be hanged. 

5. If all letters are guessed, the execution is stalled.

6. At 12 wrong guesses, the man is hanged and the game is over.
