-- Project Description --

The goal of this project was to build a game with python.

I chose the game "hangman" as I used to play it frequently as a child.


-- About this Repository --

The repository contains the following files:
1. README
2. Hangman
- game code

The file "Hangman" follows the structure below:

1 Code Snippets (steps of developing the code)
1.1   Game preparation
1.2   Playing the game
1.2.1 Player 1
1.2.2 Player 2
1.2.3 Player 1 again
1.2.4 Wrap Up

2 Summary & Condension (combination of functions)


-- HANGMAN - How to Play --

1. Hangman is a game that can be played individually, in groups or with competing parties.

2. The goal is to guess the letters of a word thought up by the hangman within a limited number of trials.

3. For every wrong guess, the hangman draws another stroke of a man to be hanged. 

5. If all letters are guessed, the execution is stalled.

6. At 12 wrong guesses, the man is hanged and the game is over. 
Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about what what you chose to build and why.


-- Workflow & Organization --

Step 1: Before I started coding, I validated my understanding of the rules of the game, and clustered them according to 
        a process sequence.  
Step 2: I then prioritized the rules of the game, and chose the most important for an MVP:
        These are to be able to select a letter as a player and match it with the letters of a word to be guessed.
Step 3: After I completed coding the MVP, I added more functionalities, such as the abilitiy to choose between one 
        or two players.
